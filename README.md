# Evaluation (Michael)

### Build and Run

Works after bugfix of mongodb connection string

```
 mvn clean install && docker build -t api-docker-image . && docker-compose up
```

### Data processing
```
http://localhost:8080/patents/upload
{
  "patentsUploaded": 7173,
  "classificationsUploaded": 923
}
```

# Chemical Patent Operations API 

Build and run

```
 mvn clean install && docker build -t api-docker-image . && docker-compose up
```


## Overview

This solution is a REST API based on Spring Boot defined with Swagger. The following endpoints have been implemented to operate over the chemical patents database:

# Solution details

The current solution has been designed following SOLID principles for a good understanding, flexibility and maintainability. It's been developed with a Hexagonal Architecture (AKA Ports & Adapters), treating input, output, persistence and iteractions as an external piece of the application.

Applying DDD within this architecture, we can identify the domain, use cases and isolate it.

In this case, our domain is the chemical patent inside the bounded context of chemicals. The business logic is implemented within the domain use cases. To manage user requests, a REST API IN adpater is implemented and to persist the ifnormation we count on several Mongo repository OUT adapters.

On the other hand, OpenNLP Java API has been used for Named-entity recognition, extracting person names, locations and organizations.

Also, National Library of Medicine MetaMapLite API was included before in the project to classify the different ChemDNER bio documents but was discarded at the end.

Finally, this software can follow 12 factor app methodology to be distributed and to be run in the cloud as a service.


### Installation

This API requires Maven and Docker to run.

Build artifact:
```sh
$ mvn clean install
```

Create Docker Image:
```sh
$ docker build -t api-docker-image .
```
Run Docker Image:
```sh
$ docker run -d -p 9090:8080 api-docker-image
```

Run Docker Compose:
```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

Now the Spring Boot Application will be reachable through the next URL:
http://localhost:9091/swagger-ui.html
